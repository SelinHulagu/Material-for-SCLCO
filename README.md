# Material-for-SCLCO

This repository contains the source code of SCLCO (Supply Chain Life Cycle Optimization) model and an example dataset for the computational experiments reported in Hülagü et al.(2023).  

SCLCO integrates LCA and SCO. SCLCO model is based on LCA data structure and encompasses multi-time closed-loop SCO decisions (e.g. reverse chain management, inventory control, network design) while considering the three pillars of sustainability; environmental, economic, and social.

The SCLCO model aims to propose a generic model formulation that enhances accessibility of LCA practitioners or researchers to SCM concepts and vice versa. Moreover, it opens up new opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange between these two, traditionally separate domains. As a result, it enhances the overall understanding and application of sustainability principles in supply chain decision-making.
